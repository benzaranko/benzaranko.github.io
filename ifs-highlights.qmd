## Fiscal traffic lights 

This is probably the piece of IFS work I'm proudest of: an analysis of the problems with the UK's approach to fiscal policy and a detailed proposal for what an alternative fiscal framework could look like. 

[**From fiscal rules to fiscal traffic lights: rethinking the UK fiscal framework**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/fiscal-rules-fiscal-traffic-lights-rethinking-uk-fiscal-framework){target="_blank"}, Institute for Fiscal Studies, February 2026.

Watch me present the key findings and recommendations, followed by a panel discussion with Rupert Harrison, Victoria Clarke and Chris Giles, chaired by Gus O'Donnell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_quJWjDc1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_quJWjDc1E){target="_blank"}

## Other work on fiscal policy 

I've published work on a wide range of other fiscal policy topics. Some selected highlights include:

- [**A note of caution on fiscal technocracy**](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/note-caution-fiscal-technocracy){target="_blank"}, Institute for Fiscal Studies, May 2024 - an argument that we should be cautious about handing over gerater powers over fiscal policy to unelected technocrats. 

- [**Public investment: what you need to know**](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/public-investment-what-you-need-know){target="_blank"}, Institute for Fiscal Studies, April 2024 - an explainer and discussion of the key policy and measurement issues related to public investment. 

- [**Public sector net worth as a fiscal target**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/public-sector-net-worth-fiscal-target){target="_blank"}, Institute for Fiscal Studies Green Budget, October 2023 - an exploration of the pros and cons (mainly cons) of targeting public sector net worth.  

- [**Chancellors’ responses to economic news**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/chancellors-responses-economic-news){target="_blank"} (with Carl Emmerson, Isabel Stockton and Sam van de Schootbrugge), Institute for Fiscal Studies Green Budget, September 2023 - a nice piece of analysis demonstrating that Chancellors react asymmetrically to economic shocks, spending more when there's 'good news' and borrowing more when there's 'bad news'. 

- [**Public spending, pay and pensions**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/public-spending-pay-and-pensions){target="_blank"} (with Bee Boileau and Laurence O'Brien), Institute for Fiscal Studies Green Budget, October 2022 - includes, among other things, analysis of public-private differentials in pay and pensions. 

- The [**IFS Be the Chancellor**](https://ifs.org.uk/be-chancellor){target="_blank"} tool, which lets you alter plans for tax and public spending, and see the impact on the public finances. 

## Public sector productivity 

To my knowledge, this report (co-authored with Max Warner in December 2022) was the first to draw attention to the pronounced reduction in NHS productivity after the pandemic: [**NHS funding, resources and teratment volumes**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/nhs-funding-resources-and-treatment-volumes){target="_blank"}. I summarised the findings in (my most successful ever) X/Twitter thread [here](https://x.com/BenZaranko/status/1602935890036269057?s=20){target="_blank"} and discussed the report on [BBC More or Less](t.co/Id2HNpMIQz){target="_blank"} with Tim Harford. (I've also been on More or Less to discuss [Baumol's cost disease](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0jr54c5){target="_blank"} and how [NHS productivity](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002phn1) is performing in more recent data),

I've published various other analyses of public sector productivity, including:

- [**Productivity in the Crown Court**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/productivity-crown-court){target="_blank"} (with Magdalena Dominguez and Joe Tomlinson), Institute for Fiscal Studies, June 2025. 
- [**NHS hospital productivity: some positive news**](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/nhs-hospital-productivity-some-positive-news ){target="_blank"} (with Olly Harvey-Rich and Max Warner), Institute for Fiscal Studies, November 2024. 
- [**The fiscal implications of public service productivity**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/fiscal-implications-public-service-productivity){target="_blank"} (with Max Warner), Institute for Fiscal Studies, May 2024. 
- [**Is there really an NHS productivity crisis?**](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/there-really-nhs-productivity-crisis){target="_blank"} (with Max Warner), Institute for Fiscal Studies, November 2023.
