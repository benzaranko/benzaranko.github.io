[Brief bio, etc, to be completed]

I'm an economist and Associate Director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in London. 

I lead IFS work on the public finances and have published research across a range of economic and fiscal policy issues. Between 2021 and 2023 and again in 2025, I was co-editor of the IFS Green Budget, the Institute's flagshp annual publication. My academic work focuses on the performance, productivity and distributional implications of the health care system. 

I have discussed my research in more than 200 broadcast interviews, I write a regular column for The Observer, and I have given evidence to three parliamentary select committees. 

I hold undergraduate and masters degrees in economics from the University of Oxford and University College London, respectively. You can find a copy of my CV here [PDF link to be added].
