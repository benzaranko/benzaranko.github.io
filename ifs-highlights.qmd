## Fiscal traffic lights 

[**From fiscal rules to fiscal traffic lights: rethinking the UK fiscal framework**](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/fiscal-rules-fiscal-traffic-lights-rethinking-uk-fiscal-framework){target="_blank"}, Institute for Fiscal Studies, February 2026.  

This is probably the piece of IFS work I'm proudest of: an analysis of the problems with the UK's approach to fiscal policy and a detailed proposal for what an alternative fiscal framework could look like. 

Watch/listen to a discussion the proposals with Helen Miller on the IFS Zooms In podcast:
